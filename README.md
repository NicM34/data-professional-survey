## 🌟 About the Project
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze survey responses from data professionals. The goal is to uncover key insights about salary distribution, job satisfaction, and regional differences in the field.

## 📊 Data Source
The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**, containing responses from data professionals worldwide. The data includes information on salary, job roles, industry, location, experience, and satisfaction levels.

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Before analysis, the data was processed using the following techniques:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Removed or imputed missing responses.
- **Standardizing Job Titles**: Mapped similar job roles to a common set of categories.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional columns like `Salary Brackets` and `Experience Levels`.
- **Region Classification**: Grouped countries into broader regions for easier comparison.

## 📈 Key Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- **Treemap**: Visualizing job roles by region with dynamic filtering.
- **Bar Charts**: Salary distributions across experience levels and industries.
- **KPI Cards**: Highlighting key insights such as **average salary**, **most common job title**, and **overall job satisfaction score**.
- **Heatmap**: Showing the correlation between job satisfaction and salary.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings
From the analysis, the following key insights emerged:
- **Salary Trends**: Higher experience levels correlate with increased salaries, but some industries pay significantly more than others.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Data professionals in certain regions report higher job satisfaction despite lower salaries.
- **Regional Disparities**: Salaries and job opportunities vary significantly by region.

## 🎛️ Interactive Features
The dashboard includes:
- **Region-based Filtering**: Selecting a region updates all visualizations dynamically.
- **Drill-Down Functionality**: Users can explore salary trends by job role, industry, and experience level.
- **Hover-over Insights**: Tooltips provide additional data details when hovering over visuals.

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge:** Data inconsistency in job titles and missing values.
- **Solution:** Used data cleaning techniques like text standardization and imputation.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to:
- Implement **predictive analytics** to forecast salary trends.
- Add **time-series analysis** for salary growth over years.
- Explore deeper **industry-specific insights**.
